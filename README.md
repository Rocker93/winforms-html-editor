# Windows Forms HTML Editor

Simple Windows Forms HTML Editor based on [TinyMCE] and [BrutalDeveloper] blog post.

[BrutalDeveloper] post was based on older version of [TinyMCE] and used popups, that are not working correctly on newer operating systems. This version uses [TinyMCE] 4, that no longer requires popups and also has some new features.

It is also possible to enable/ disable additional TinyMCE features in [TinyMCE Settings]

Tested and working on Windows 10.
